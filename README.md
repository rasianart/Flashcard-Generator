# Flashcard-Generator

Flashcard-Generator is a streamlined and intuitive process of creating, storing, and reading digital flashcards.

Flashcard-Generator utilizes two methods of reading/storing: basic and cloze-delete

Basic cards operate with a front/back method.  The front contains the complete question.  The back contains the answer.

Cloze-deleted cards operated with a partial display method.  The answer is ommitted from the card statement and replaced with "..."

3 Focal Pathways:

1. Create 
2. Read
3. Random
